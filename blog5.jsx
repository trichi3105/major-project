                        The custom web development process typically involves the following stages:
                        <br />
                        <div className={s.subHead}>4.1 Discovery and Planning</div>
                        During this stage, the web development agency will work closely with the business to understand its goals, target audience, branding, and functionality requirements. This stage may involve conducting market research, competitive analysis, and user testing to ensure that the website is designed to meet the business's specific needs.
                        <br />
                        <div className={s.subHead}>4.2 Design</div>
                        Once the discovery and planning stage is complete, the web development agency will move on to the design stage. During this stage, the agency will create a visual representation of the website that takes into account the business's branding and user experience requirements. This may involve creating wireframes, prototypes, and mockups to ensure that the design meets the business's needs and goals.
                        <br />
                        <div className={s.subHead}>4.3 Development</div>
                        The development stage is where the actual coding and implementation of the website takes place. The web development agency will use the design created in the previous stage to build the website from scratch. This stage may involve front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), back-end development (PHP, Node.js, Ruby on Rails), and database integration (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
                        <br />
                        <div className={s.subHead}>4.4 Testing and Deployment</div>
                        Once the website has been built, the web development agency will move on to the testing and deployment stage. During this stage, the website will be tested for functionality, usability, and performance to ensure that it meets the business's needs and goals. Once the website has been tested and approved, it will be deployed to a live server.
                        <br />
                        <div className={s.subHead}>4.5 Maintenance and Support</div>
                        The final stage of the custom web development process is maintenance and support. Once the website is live, the web development agency will provide ongoing maintenance and support to ensure that the website continues to function properly and meets the business's evolving needs.

                        <div className={s.subHead}>7.1 Scope Creep</div>
                        Scope creep refers to the tendency for a custom web development project to expand beyond its original scope. This can happen when new features or requirements are added during the development process, which can lead to delays and increased costs. To avoid scope creep, it's important to have a clear understanding of the project's goals and requirements before starting development. Any changes or additions to the project should be carefully considered and documented.

                        <div className={s.subHead}>7.2 Communication Issues</div>
                        Effective communication is essential to the success of a custom web development project. Communication issues can arise when there is a lack of clarity or understanding between the business and the web development agency. To overcome communication issues, it's important to establish clear lines of communication from the outset of the project. Regular check-ins and updates can help ensure that everyone is on the same page.
                        <br />
                        <div className={s.subHead}>7.3 Technical Challenges</div>
                        Custom web development projects can involve complex technical challenges, such as integrating with third-party APIs or databases. To overcome technical challenges, it's important to work with a web development agency that has expertise in the specific areas required for the project. Regular testing and quality assurance can also help identify and address technical issues before they become major problems.
